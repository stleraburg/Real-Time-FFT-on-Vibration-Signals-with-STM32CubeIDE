# Real-Time-FFT-on-Vibration-Signals-with-STM32CubeIDE
This project uses two ADXL335 analog accelerometers to measure vibrations injected with ERM vibration motor. STM32 Cube IDE software is used for microcontroller programming and STM32 Cube Monitor visualizes FFT charts in real-time.  The code also includes an opportunity to save signals as .csv files on micro SD card for the further analysis.
